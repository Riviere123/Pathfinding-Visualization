# Pathfinding Visualization
 
You will need Pygame installed to run the script since it is a dependancy. 
Command to install pygame: pip install pygame
Run Main.py
A grid of squares should apear.

Controls:
LMB: Place walls
RMB: Delete walls
Q: Place the start point
W: Place the end point

Once you place the start and end node the grid should now show as a heatmap. The heatmap represents the score(if you're familiar with A*) of each node. The A* pathfinding alogrithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path from two points. If you look at the RZU-7 project you can see it also implemented in game form where the AI is capable of traversing its environment based on nodes and decision trees.
